Project Proposal

My project proposal is an advanced database for music categorization and sorting aimed for DJs and/or general music 
curators. With every digital release of a song containing a plethora of information ranging from data surrounding the 
nature of the release (date, record label, album, etc.), musical elements (key, tempo, etc.), and genre and subgenres 
(house, nu disco, techno, etc.), this presents a prime opportunity for relating dozens of attributes in a robust database. 
For this database, I hope to get even more granular by further considering attributes not commonly included in common music 
libraries (e.g., Apple music, Spotify, etc.) that would be of immense use to DJs looking to construct a cohesive mix 
consisting of songs that work well together to achieve a desired “vibe.” Some of these attributes could include main chord 
progressions used throughout out a song, length of downtempo used in intros and outros, number of different versions of 
songs (e.g, extended mixes, instrumentals, remixes), and peak loudness achieved throughout a song. Ultimately, I could see 
a database like this being integrated with machine learning technology and DJ software such as Traktor and rekordbox to 
provide real-time suggestions for next songs to mix during a live DJ set.
